# Project: Micro-Reddit

Let's build [Reddit](http://reddit.com).  Well, maybe a very junior version of it called `micro-reddit`.  In this project, you'll build the data structures necessary to support link submissions and commenting.  We won't build a front end for it because we don't need to... you can use the Rails console to play around with models without the overhead of making HTTP requests and involving controllers or views.
